Explanation of files

<b>OneWeb_constellation.gif:</b> A graphical simulation of the OneWeb constellation.

<b>Base-band simulations:</b> Simulation scripts able to simulate the bit-error rate and symbol-error rates of BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM and 64-QAM. All these are run in base-band, omitting the waveform modulation part.

<b>Pass-band simulations:</b> Contains a BPSK pass-band simulator, that modulates the I and Q values on a cosine and sine converting them to pass-band, and downconverts to base-band recovering the transmitted signals.
